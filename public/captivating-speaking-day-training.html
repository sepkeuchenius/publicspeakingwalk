          I'm very thankful for this public speaking course. I didn't know what to expect from a public speaking teacher but I was really impressed by Mewis and the skills he has in speaking and creating a comfortable learning environment, and his ability to teach the underlying principles of each speaking skill to us. I learnt a lot about myself, about speaking and social interactions. I'm very grateful for this experience, and I think is beneficial for everyone!

      Mewis is great, he managed to teach my group and me public speaking while having fun. Enthusiastic, competent, and caring coach. His energy is contagious. I glad that I met him and that I had him as a coach!!

          Recently I finished a public speaking fundamentals course with Mewis. He’s a very nice coach  whose warmth and openness gave me confidence to speak up during every lesson and fight my fear of public speaking. Extremely recommended to try if you need more skills to talk and be heard during speeches

          Een heel interactieve training waar ik de ins en outs van het spreken voor publiek meegekregen heb, en wat Mewis met veel enthousiasme en energie verzorgd heeft!

         Mewis kan op vermakelijke wijze over serieuze onderwerpen college geven. Mewis houdt een groep mensen met verschillende achtergronden lang geboeid, en spreekt inspirerend over psychologie, zijn eigen ervaring en het leven.
